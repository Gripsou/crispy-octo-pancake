===================

Repository content
------------------

### Brief

_KiCad_ plugin development sandbox repository.


### Goal

It aims to be the place where I learn and experiment with how to develop and
build any pluggin feature I would like to add/use in my personnal _KiCad_
projects.


### External docs & sources

Since this is a _KiCad_ plugin, it follows the rules given in _KiCad_
_Developpers Documentation_ about
[KiCad Addons](https://dev-docs.kicad.org/en/addons/).


### Important Note

This work is very early stage and at the moment I have no intention nor
motivation anymore to make anything crazy here, so don't expect this to be
usable at any point soon.


### Repository file tree

I have more or less replicated the structure of a plugin archive structure for
this directory file tree :

```

  +-> plugins/
  |   +-> __init__.py
  |   +-> ...

  +-> LICENSE*

```
